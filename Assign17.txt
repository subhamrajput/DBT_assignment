1. Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of
   cnum and snum are different from one another, and so that NULL values are
   excluded from the date field.

	CREATE TABLE ORDERS
	(
	  ONUM	INT(4) PRIMARY KEY,
	  SNUM	INT(4) PRIMARY KEY,
	  CNUM	INT(4) PRIMARY KEY,
	  ODATE	DATE NOT NULL
	);

2. Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no
   NULLS permitted, snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically
   between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).
	
	CREATE TABLE SALESPEOPLE
	(
	   COMM	  INT(4) DEFAULT 10,
	   SNUM   INT(4) PRIMARY KEY,
	   SNAME  VARCHAR(25) CHECK(SUBSTR(UPPER(SNAME),1,1) BETWEEN 'A' AND 'M')
	);

3. Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, and
   the cnum is greater that the snum.
   Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.

	CREATE TABLE ORDER
	(
	  ONUM	INT(4) NOT NULL,
	  SNUM	INT(4) NOT NULL,
	  CNUM	INT(4) NOT NULL,
	  CHECK(ONUM>CNUM AND CNUM>SNUM)
	);
